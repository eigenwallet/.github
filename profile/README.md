# eigenwallet
_eigenwallet_ is an ambitious community effort to build the Monero wallet for the future. 

In this organization we host multiple repositories which contain all the open source code for our different subprojects:

 - In [`core`](https://github.com/eigenwallet/core) we maintain a monorepo which contains the code for the wallet, peer-to-peer network and atomic swaps
 - In [`vision`](https://github.com/eigenwallet/vision) we host the source code for our [website](https://eigenwallet.org)

Join our [Matrix space](https://matrix.to/#/#unstoppableswap-space:matrix.org) to follow our development more closely.

> The project was previously known as _UnstoppableSwap_.
