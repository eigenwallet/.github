# UnstoppableSwap
This is UnstoppableSwap, the trustless and secure software for Bitcoin <-> Monero atomic swaps. 

In this organization we host multiple repositories which contain all the open source code for our different subprojects:


 - In [`core`](https://github.com/UnstoppableSwap/core) we maintain a monorepo which contains the rust binaries as well as our new GUI based on Tauri
 - In [`unstoppableswap-docs`](https://github.com/UnstoppableSwap/unstoppableswap-docs) we write documentation for our [docs page](https://docs.unstoppableswap.net) about atomic swaps in general as well as our software
 - In [`asb-docker-compose`](https://github.com/UnstoppableSwap/asb-docker-compose) we provide accessable docker images for those interested in running a swap provider service
 - In [`unstoppableswap-site`](https://github.com/UnstoppableSwap/unstoppableswap-site) we host the source code for our main [website](https://unstoppableswap.net/)
 - _In [`unstoppableswap-gui`](https://github.com/UnstoppableSwap/unstoppableswap-gui) we host the archive of the source code to our old legacy graphical user interface (GUI)_

Join our [Matrix space](https://matrix.to/#/#unstoppableswap-space:matrix.org) to follow our development more closely.
